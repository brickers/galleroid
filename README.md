# galleroid
A CSS3 and jQuery picture gallery with polaroid-style previews

This is a responsive picture gallery suited to showing project work, with a polaroid-style thumbnail for each project. When the thumbnail is clicked, the polaroid expands to show a larger photo plus accompanying text, and offers the ability to cycle through more pictures and text about parts of the project.
