# galleroid
A CSS3 and jQuery picture gallery with polaroid-style previews

This is a responsive picture gallery suited to showing project work, with a polaroid-style thumbnail for each project. When the thumbnail is clicked, the polaroid expands to show a larger photo plus accompanying text, and offers the ability to cycle through more pictures and text about parts of the project.

To use Galleroid, create a div with the id 'galleroid' at the place in your html file where you'd like galleroid to appear. Make sure that jQuery 3.2.1 or greater is included, followed by galleroid.js, and also include galleroid.css. You can edit the content of Galleroid itself in galleroid.html. index.html shows a sample page, which can be seen in action [here](www.galleroid.feargusbrickley.com)
